# PULSEira

## Introduction

This project is a wearable bracelet that vibrates with the intensity of a music, with the goal to help deaf people to feel the music. He was developed on the Instrumentation and Control class 2017.2 of the Automation and System Departament, at Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) in Brazil. This GitHub repository has the objective to share all the progress and try to find partners to continue the project.

## Description

It is a bracelet, manufactured on a 3D printer, with sensors that measure the ambient sound and process all the informations on an Arduino, the information processed is amplified by some transistors and sended by PWM to the DC motor. The DC motor is builded to vibrate (it's obtained from a old Playstation 1 control).
